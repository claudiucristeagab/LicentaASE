Author: Cristea Claudiu-Gabriel

What it does:
- Connects to the MS SQL Server database.
- It lets users create their own SQL commands without any previous knowledge of SQL.
- Lets them do statistics on the database data.
- Can create charts.
- Can create HTML reports that consist of multiple items. Each item of a report has at the base an SQL query that can be written manually, imported from a file or generated using the built-in Query (Select) Builder. The report contains statistics, charts and even the raw output.
